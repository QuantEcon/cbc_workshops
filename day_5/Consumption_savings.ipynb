    "This exercise is inspired from *Individual learning about consumption* by Todd Allen and Chris Carroll [link](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/72016/1/328292125.pdf). It is also example of a policy gradient algorithm.\n",

    "We consider the following consumption saving problem. An agent receives random income $y_t = \\exp(\\epsilon_t)$ where $\\epsilon_t\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\sigma)$ ($\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer starts the period with available income $w_t$. The law of motion for available income is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_t = \\exp(\\epsilon_t) + (w_{t-1}-c_{t-1}) r$$\n",

    "The theoretical solution to this problem is a concave function $\\varphi$ such that $\\varphi(x)\\in ]0,x]$ and $\\forall t,  c_t=\\varphi(w_t)$. Qualitatively, agents accumulate savings, up to a certain point (a buffer stock), beyond which wealth is not increasing any more (in expectation).\n",
