Must do

- Reorganize

    - day 1 = Python (getting started, functions), NumPy (MCs, pass by ref), SciPy (equilib.)
    - day 2 = Numba, JAX (nd equilib, european option, sS dynamics)
    - day 3 = Fixed points, Newton for FPs, job search
    - day 4 = DP theory, DP with JAX

- Add asset pricing exercises to Markov chain notebook (or make separate notebook)

- Integrate SS dynamics notebook


Might do

- Prep Arellano JAX version?

- Prep Elliot et al. default cascades?

- Add cuda version of GPU programming to European option example, just to
illustrate?

- Discuss Leontief / IO with supply constraints (monotone concave operators)?

- Add Toda example and solve by autodiff?

- Test Anderson Acceleration with VFI?

- R&D with IID costs as an example of dimensionality reduction?

- Introduce NumPy via Leontief / IO?
