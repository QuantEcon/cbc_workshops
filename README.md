# Central Bank of Chile Scientific Computing Workshops

This is the homepage for the [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) scientific
and high performance computing workshops to be held at the Central Bank of
Chile in May 2022.

Instructors:

* John Stachurski (Australian National University, Co-founder of QuantEcon)
* Pablo Winant (CREST and ESCP Business School, lead developer of [dolo](https://github.com/EconForge/dolo.py)

The languages of instruction are Python and Julia.  Instruction will draw on,
but not be limited to, the 

* [QuantEcon Python Programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) lecture series
* [QuantEcon Julia Programming](https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html) lecture series


## Format

The workshops will consist of two courses:

1. Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python and Julia
2. High Performance Computing and Macroeconomic Modeling with Julia

Each course will run for three days.  Proposed dates are

* Course 1: May 2nd, 3rd and 4th
* Course 2: May 5th, 6th and 9th

The format of the courses will be 

* Lectures: 10am -- 12am 
* Revision and tutorials: 1pm -- 3pm 

Non-graded homework assignments will also be provided.

## Prerequisites

All participants are expected to bring laptop computers.

If possible, participants should bring laptops with the ability to install
open source software.

For those without such permissions, a cloud computing option will be provided. 

The courses assume knowledge of the fundamentals of linear algebra,
analysis and probability.
