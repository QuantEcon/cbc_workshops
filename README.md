# Central Bank of Chile Scientific Computing Workshops

![](qe-logo-large.png)

This is the homepage for the [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) scientific
and high performance computing workshops to be held at the Central Bank of
Chile in September 2022.

Instructors:

* John Stachurski (Australian National University, Co-founder of QuantEcon)
* Pablo Winant (CREST and ESCP Business School, lead developer of [dolo](https://github.com/EconForge/dolo.py)

The languages of instruction are Python and Julia.  Instruction will draw on,
but not be limited to, the 

* [QuantEcon Python Programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) lecture series
* [QuantEcon Julia Programming](https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html) lecture series


## Format

The schedule is

* September 20th - 23rd: Scientific computing with Python
* September 24th - 25th: Weekend break
* September 26th - 27th: Scientific computing with Julia

The format of each day will be

* 08:30 - 10:30: Lecture
* 10:30 - 11:00: Coffee Break
* 11:00 - 13:00: Practice Sessions
* 13:00 - 14:30: Lunch (at Central Bank offices)
* 14:30 - 16:00: Office hours


## Prerequisites

All participants should bring laptop computers.  If possible, participants
should bring laptops with the ability to install open source software.

For those without such permissions, a cloud computing option will be provided. 

The courses assume knowledge of the fundamentals of linear algebra,
analysis, optimization and probability.
